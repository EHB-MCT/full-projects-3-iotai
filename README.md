# <p align='center'>**EvoMission**

EvoMission is an educational and amusing game created for the Musuem of Natural Sciences located in Brussels, Belgium.

<hr>

## **Concept**

We launched this project to attract more Zoomers to the museum. We believe that majority of the Zoomers think of museums solely as a rather boring but educational interaction. Therefore we have created a game (takes place inside the museum) that is not only educational but also fun to play.

<hr>

## **How to play?**

### **Amount of people**

The game will start with a group of people (anywhere between 5 and 20 people)

### **Assigning roles**

At the start of the game, players will get assigned a role. You are either a Scientist or a Dinosaur, a Scientist their objective is to complete tasks, which are spread out across the museum, and to not get eliminated by the Dinosaurs. On the other hand, a dinosaur their task is to eliminate Scientists and to not get detected doing so.

### **Completing a task**

Your tasks will be shown to you on the map on the main screen of the game. You can read more about a specific task by clicking on the respective number on the map. Clicking on this number will pop up further instructions on what to do to complete this task. You can locate where this task takes places by navigating yourself through the museum by using the map shown to you on your app.

### **Eliminating a Scientist**

WIP

### **Reporting a murder**

Whenever you spotted a Scientist who has been eliminated, you can report this by using your the provided button on the main screen. Reporting a murder will also automatically call a meeting

### **Calling a meeting**

Calling a meeting also happens by pressing the button shown on your app. During a meeting the players will discus what they have done and what they saw. At the end of the meeting, they get the option to vote out a suspicious player or to skip vote. The player with the most votes will get ejected and in turn also 'dies'. This player can no longer communicate with others but can still complete their tasks to help their team win.

### **How to win?**

Scientists win when they have completed all their tasks or have successfully voted off the Dinosaurs during a meeting.

Dinosaurs win by eliminating scientists until the remaining amount of scientists are the same as the amount of Dinosaurs, making it impossible to vote out a dinosaur if they work together. Dinosaurs can also win if the tasks were not completely within the given time range.

### **Backend Repository**

We are also using our own REST API for this project. [Click here](https://github.com/StephanVanHemelrijck/iotai-backend) to be directed to the GitHub repo of our backend.
